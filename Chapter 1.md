# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable and Maintainable applications

## Introduction

- Many applications today are data intensive
- A data intensive app is an app which needs these terms:
  - Database: saving data to use later
  - Search Indexes: searching over these data
  - Caches: remembering the result of expensive operations
  - Streams: sending messages to other systems asynchronously
  - Batches: Proccessing large amounts of data

- No one needs to build these things from scrach because databases are perfect tools for these tasks
